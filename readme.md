## Blog.dev: Portfolio Plus


This site contains a number of functions. 

First, it serves as a complete portfolio site, able to showcase and highlight specific projects as well as display an archive of other projects. This is completed with a basic site layout using navigation links both in the navbar and on a display page. Laravel helps with routing between pages, enabling the user to change out featured pages with ease. 

As part of the portfolio aspect, the home page features a splash section for personal information, a skills and resume section, and a contact section. Each section is linked in the navbar with anchor tags to direct the user to the proper section. Within each section are also links to return to the top of the page.

The second aspect of this site is a blog. The owner of the site can add, create, edit, and delete posts. Ownership is verfified through a log-in process. Users who are not logged in can view all blog posts or view posts individually.

Google Materialize and navbar layout changes ensure compatibility with mobile browsing.
